# Pacman

<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="https://github.com/BatuhanGunes/Pacman/blob/master/Screenshot/Game3.gif">

This project has been programmed as a version of the classic Pacman game. The game is completed by guiding our character named pacman and passing it over all the bait objects in predefined positions on the map. The baits passing through are destroyed and 10 points are added. At this stage, Pacman needs to escape 3 different enemies. The character has 3 lives. If the character comes into contact with any of the enemies, he will lose a life. After all lives are over, the game ends and the episode fails. At the same time, character and enemies cannot pass through walls, another object on the map. Enemies attack their position to reach the character. The character is managed by the user. We can explain the functions used in directing the character as follows;

* W -> Provides upward movement.
* A -> Provides left movement.
* S -> Provides downward movement
* D -> Provides right movement
* Q -> Provides stop.

Another function of the game is that you can edit the chapters yourself. After editing, you can save the new map or load a different map. It is necessary to use mouse buttons for this process. The keys can be used as one click or drag. These keys and their functions;

- Left click   -> Adds a wall object to the current location.
- Middle click -> Adds a feed object to the current location.
- Right click  -> Removes the object at the current location.
- F1           -> Saves the map.
- F2           -> Loads the map from the file.
